# Ratings Analyzer Implementation
## Project Description
This is the readme file for the Ratings Analyzer project. The RatingAnalyzerImpl.java
file houses the RatingAnalyzerImpl class that implements the RatingAnalyzer interface.
Each instantiation of the class stores an integer array. It will check to ensure the
array is not empty and that it isn't null either. The methods that can be performed
determine the mean (average), median, and modes of the numbers that occur within the
stored array.
